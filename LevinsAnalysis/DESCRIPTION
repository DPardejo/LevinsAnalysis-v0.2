Description: The LevinsAnalysis package is a collection of functions to analyse
   the structure and nodal interaction levels and single-paths information 
   present within a stable Ecological Community Network. It allows to compute predictions 
   about the response of variables to press perturbations in one or more entry points 
   in the Community Network using the loop analysis formula. It makes so using an 
   innovative quantitative methodology to analyse those results and to compute a 
   graphical visualization of both the Ecological Community Network and the Table 
   of Predictions.
